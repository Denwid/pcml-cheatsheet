PCML Cheat Sheet
================
This is a collaborative cheat sheet for the EPFL (http://epfl.ch/) class "Pattern recognition and machine learning".
It will be exactly two pages in the end to take with you to the exam.
Make it your own cheat sheet and work with me if you like its style.

Guidlines for collaboration
---------------------------

Make it NICE! Also, don't be shy: if you think there's a bug, report it on the [Issues](../../issues) page!

Notation:
- Like in Emti's slides in general (e.g. bold for vectors), discuss on the [Issues](../../issues) page if something is not clear
- Make it consistent with otherwise available notation as much as possible
- Notation should be very clear in context, if we need to explain notation, we will do it in a separate document

Content:
- Cover all topics in Emti's summary (some intuition, mostly hard hard facts, formulas, rules and examples)
- 2 pages max (we can overflow at first, but we will make a 2 pages version for the exam)

Administrative stuff:
- Use [Issues](../../issues) page to discuss problems or raise doubts (for easy things: just fix and commit)
- A rendered PDF should be pushed along every change for convenience
- **Make sure to declare sources** if figures or such are used
