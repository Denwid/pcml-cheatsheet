PCML Cheat Sheet
================
This is a collaborative cheat sheet for the EPFL (http://epfl.ch/) class "Pattern recognition and machine learning".
It will be exactly two pages in the end to take with you to the exam.
Make it your own cheat sheet and work with me if you like its style.

Guidlines for collaboration
---------------------------

Make it NICE!

Notation:
- Like in Emti's slides in general (e.g. bold for vectors), discuss in github issues page if something is not clear
- Make it consistent with otherwise available notation as much as possible
- Notation should be very clear in context, if we need to explain notation, we will do it in a separate document

Content:
- Cover all topics in Emtis summary (some intuition, mostly hard hard facts, formulas, rules and examples)
- 2 pages max (can overflow but reduce at the end)

Administrative stuff:
- use github issues page to discuss problems (easy things: just fix and commit)
- a rendered pdf should always be available with every release for convenience
- make sure to declare sources if figures or thelike are used
